### WEB INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN PROJECT...............

0x09. Web infrastructure design
Design of a web stack diagram and sysadmin/devops. Acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

What is a server?
A server is a device, a virtual device or computer program or providing functionality for other programs or devices, called “clients”

What is a web server?
A web server is a software that serves web pages to clients upon their request, it does this over the protocol HTTP.

What is a codebase?
Is the collection of source code that is used to build a software system.

What is a database?
Is a collection of information that is stored and organized so that it can be easily accessed, updated and managed.

What is a DNS?
A system to translate domain names into IP addresses.

What is HTTPS?
A version of HTTP that secure the traffic between your browser and the website by encrypting it.

What is TCP/IP?
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communications protocols used to interconnect network devices on the Internet or any private network.

SPOF
A single point of failure (SPOF) is a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. SPOFs are undesirable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability, be it a business practice, software application, or other industrial system.

LAMP
LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) is a very common example of a web service stack, named as an acronym of the names of its original four open-source components: the Linux operating system, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database management system (RDBMS), and the PHP programming language. The LAMP components are largely interchangeable and not limited to the original selection. As a solution stack, LAMP is suitable for building dynamic web sites and web applications.

QPS
"Query rate" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Query throughput.

Queries per second (QPS) is a common measure of the amount of search traffic an information retrieval system, such as a search engine or a database, receives during one second.[1] The term is used more broadly for any request–response system, more correctly called requests per second (RPS).

High-traffic systems must watch their QPS in order to know when to scale the system to handle more load.
